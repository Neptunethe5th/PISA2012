## Dataset

> PISA is a survey of students' skills and knowledge as they approach the end of compulsory education. It is not a conventional school test. Rather than examining how well students have learned the school curriculum, it looks at how well prepared they are for life beyond school.


> Around 510,000 students in 65 economies took part in the PISA 2012 assessment of reading, mathematics and science representing about 28 million 15-year-olds globally. Of those economies, 44 took part in an assessment of creative problem solving and 18 in an assessment of financial literacy.




## Summary of Findings

> Teacher's support and Disciplinary climate played an important role to support students perservation.

> Students who had low perservation was more tending to having low support or being offered low disciplined classrooms, and on the opposite side, those who high support/High disciplinary climate in classrooms showed better perservation.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> OECD-Countries tended to have higher overall grades in maths than those in Non-OECD Countries.

> Teacher's support had helped students get better grades in Non-OECD countries over those in OECD countries --More effective for some reason--

> Students who had low-affection for maths, had low scores on maths despite having teacher's support by them.

> On the other hand, having desciplined climate had more of an effect over teacher's support, in getting students to score higher.
